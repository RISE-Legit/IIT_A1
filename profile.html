					<h1><br><br>My education to date.</h1>
						<p>After leaving high school, I had no idea what I wanted to be doing and as a result of that I went off and tried my hand at a number of things. Here are some of the certificates I earned along the way.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Year 12 Senior</li>
							<li>Certificate III In Retail</li>
							<li>Certificate II In Automotive Mechanical</li>
							<li>Certificate II In Engineering</li>
							<li>Certificate II in Surface Extraction Operations</li>
							<li>Certificate II In Information Technology</li>
							<li>Certificate II In Security Operations</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I've also spent a year of full time study at SAE working towards my audio engineering degree. However, I got bored of that and decided that te struggle of full time study on what minimal support the government provided wasn't worth it.</p>

						<h1>Languages spoken.</h1>
						<p>I feel like I speak English fairly proficiently, having spent most of my childhoof reading books of all types. However, I did much prefer modern science fiction novels, which allowed my imagination to wander. I believe this helkped set the stage for my future creative endeavours.</p>
						<p>If I had the chance to learn a new language, I would choose to learn Russian. Although, it would probably be more practically useful if I were to learn Mandarin or something similar.</p>
						<h1>Hobbies.</h1>
						<p>For the past 18 or 19 years, I have been an amateur producer of electronic music. I have become somewhat proficient at it. I started out using Fruityloops 3, and Reason 2. By no means were my first creations listenable, but they sure did make me feel like I had accomplished something. This is the only hobby I have been consistently attempting to get better at over the years. Other hobbys have fallen by the wayside.</p>
						<h1>My interests in IT.</h1>
						<p>What sparked my interest in IT as a kid, was having to build a single working computer out of many broken computers. The process of discovery of different formats of cards and peripherals, confgurations of hardware, etc, was an interesting conundrum as a kid. It was mostly trial and error- see what fits where and whether or not the machine powers on afterwards.</p>
						<p>It then went on from there to trying to squeeze the most out of the hardware I had. Buying new hardware was prohibitvely expensive, and sometimes just not possible as the hardware I was on was very dated. My first PC, the one I started making music on, was a 222MHz Intel CPU, 16MB of RAM and a ridiculously small HDD. Neverthelss, I mangaed to 3D render, create complex audio projects and surf the net fairly well.</p>
						<p>As far as my IT experience goes, I generally have a better memory for things IT related. I guess this comes down to an interest in the field. If you are interested by something, you are more likely to pay attention and subsequently succeed. This certainly helped me thoughout high school as I took a number of computing classes, where I did rather well in the programming classes, only being let down by my constant class interruptions and general misbehaving.</p>
						<p>I have chosen to return to study IT so as the current industry I am is dull and unfulfilling. The work isn't hard, although some days it can be physically exhausting. I find myself at odds with management who live and breathe retail and feel like a change in industry will help move me away from the humdrum.</p>
						<p>I chose RMIT as it was one of the few online offerings that seemed like a good fit. The entire enrollment process was seemless and rather quick. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who has been considering it. Studying online also allows me to work fulltime, which negates the need to choose between eating well and actually affording rent, or studying on campus (which lowers work availability) and having to eat noodles and frozen vegetables every day. The latter gets old real fast.</p>
						<p>I expect to finish with a precursory knowledge of the intracacies of the IT industry and have a nice rounded perspective on the varying aspects, allowing me to be more confident with how to proceed to my goals. Whether this be the types of software used, teamwork and collaboration or the general means by which the industry operates. A solid foundation is the basis for any successful structure.</p>
						<h1>Ideal job.</h1>
						<p><a href=https://www.seek.com.au/job/39892189?type=standout&searchRequestToken=6afc32ea-933a-402e-9372-f7a928ed8e7f>Original Job Ad (Seek.com)</a></p>

						<p>Cyber Security Operations Analyst<br>Hays Information Technology</p>
						<h1>Job Description</h1>
						<p>The job is for a security analyst who will provide ongoing support for a client in the digital healthcare sector. Their duties will include security event management (threat response, analysis and prevention) for vendors. This is appealing to me for the fact that this is an ever-evolving landscape. As the threats become more advanced, the response must also evolve. This opens the door for creative problem solving. In saying that, there is still a place for the low-level security prevention methods. I feel this would also give me great experience for taking this career further, perhaps working with the government or on more of a 'cyber frontline', if you will.
						<p>The experience required by this job would include a number of necessary skills. First of all a working knowledge of the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF)
						(Protectivesecurity.gov.au, 2019) created by the Australian Government to protect the people, information and assets of government entities both locally and abroad. Alongside the PSPF, knowledge of the Information Security Manual (ISM) (Cyber.gov.au, 2019), created by the Australian Signals Directorate would be necessary. This is a cyber security framework designed to protect the information systems of organisations.</p>
						<p>An operation analyst would also need network operational knowledge as they will be checking the organisations networks for security shortfalls as well as monitoring for breaches and responding accordingly. Their would be a lot of paperwork as well, as contingency plans will need to be drafted if there ever was a breach. Educating the staff in the organisation you work for is also an iportant part of this role, as a castle's walls can be easily undermined if a door is left open.</p>
						<p>Am I currently a good fit for this job? Not even remotely. Despite listening to a number of cyber security related podcasts and having a keen interest in this field, I have no practical experience and feel I would fall flat of a security situation were to arise. While I may know that the USA is poking around in networks in Russia, I wouldn't be able to close a port on a firewall to stop the worlds most inept hacker.</p>
						<p>To get myself to the skill level required by this position, I would need a number of years experience working in a security capacity. Whether that be as a network security operator or something similar to give me the basic skills to protect myself. I would aslo need some degree of penetration testing skills to know what I should be looking for when people do attack the network. I feel that would also give me some great technical ability. I would need to be submerged in the security operations field so as to learn the best practices and methods by which outcomes are achieved and security stability garnered.</p>
						<p>I would also need to be familiar with the government policy, namely the PSPF and ISM, but also be aware of international policy like NIST,  National Cyber Security and European Union Agency for Network and Information Security. These policies may vary on the specifics from country to country, but they do have a common goal, so being aware of their differences may prove beneficial in countering security threats as well as bolstering out one's own efforts.</p>
